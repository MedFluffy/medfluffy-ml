# MedFluffy Machine Learning
MedFluffy is a mobile application that can provide predictions of the type of physical illness experienced by cats or dogs just by taking a snap on their external and visible wounds as well as provide recommendations for first aid to cure the disease. 



## Description
This repository contains machine learning projects used in the MedFluffy mobile application (Android). It includes datasets, methods, tools, libraries, and IDEs used in the machine learning implementation of the MedFluffy mobile application.
## Method
In building the machine learning model for the MedFluffy application, we will utilize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. CNNs have proven to be highly effective in various computer vision tasks, including medical image analysis.

## Tools/IDE/Library
- Google Colab
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Keras
- Os
## Datasets
We get the dataset from website https://universe.roboflow.com/
1. Nuclear Sclerosis: https://universe.roboflow.com/dog-eyes/nuclear-sclerosis-vxo0b/browse?queryText=&pageSize=50&startingIndex=0&browseQuery=true
2. Healthy: https://universe.roboflow.com/dog-eyes/healthy-ul8lw
## Deployment
We use FastAPI to deploy the machine learning model
